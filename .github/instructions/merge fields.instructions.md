# Merge Fields & Coding Guidelines for Agents

All AI agents and LLMs must:
- Use only merge fields listed in `.github/instructions/merge-fields.md` for personalization and template logic.
- Follow all naming, structure, and workflow conventions described in `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Check both files for updates before generating or editing code/templates.
- If unsure about a field or pattern, ask for clarification or reference existing templates.

These files are the canonical source for all coding and merge field practices in this workspace.
